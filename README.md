# SQL-Ad_Hoc-Project

## Company Overview  
AtliQ Hardwares (imaginary company) is a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India, with an expanding presence across international markets. As the company scaled up, the leadership team realized the need for sharper, faster, data-driven decision-making.

## Objective  
The goal of this project was  
- Solved 10 ad hoc business questions using SQL
- Find useful insights in the data to help them make better decisions

##  Tools Used  
- **SQL** – querying and data exploration  
- **Power BI** – visualizing trends and patterns  
- **Canva / PowerPoint** – presenting insights in a clean, simple format  

##  SQL Concepts Practiced  
- WHERE – filter rows based on conditions
- DISTINCT – remove duplicate records
- CASE WHEN – apply custom logic in queries
- ORDER BY – sort data in a specific order
- LIMIT – restrict the number of rows shown
- JOIN – connect data across multiple tables
- MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM – basic aggregations
- GROUP BY – group records for summary
- DENSE_RANK() – rank rows without skipping values
- CTE (Common Table Expressions) – break complex queries into readable, manageable steps

##  Conclusion 
 This project helped me get better at writing SQL, understanding business data, and turning insights into clear visuals. It’s a step forward in my journey as a data analyst, and I’m looking forward to applying these skills in upcoming work.
